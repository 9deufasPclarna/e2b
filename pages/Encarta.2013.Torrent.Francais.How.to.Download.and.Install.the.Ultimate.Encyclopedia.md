## What was Encarta?
 
Encarta was a digital encyclopedia that was launched by Microsoft in 1993. It was available on CD-ROMs and DVDs, as well as online. Encarta contained over 60,000 articles, as well as thousands of images, videos, audio clips, maps, timelines, quizzes, and games. It also had a dictionary, a thesaurus, a translator, and a homework helper.
 
Encarta was designed to be user-friendly and interactive. It allowed users to search for topics by keywords or categories, browse through related articles, and access multimedia content. It also had a feature called MindMaze, which was a trivia game that tested the user's knowledge of various subjects.
 
Encarta was available in several languages, including English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Japanese, and Chinese. Each language edition had its own content and features tailored to the local culture and audience.
 
## Why was Encarta discontinued?
 
Encarta was discontinued by Microsoft in 2009 for several reasons. One of them was the rise of free online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia, which offered more up-to-date and diverse information than Encarta. Another reason was the decline of CD-ROMs and DVDs as storage media, as more people preferred to access information online or on mobile devices.
 
Microsoft announced that it would stop selling Encarta products by June 2009 and shut down its online services by October 2009. The last version of Encarta was released in 2008.
